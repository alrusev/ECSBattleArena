# ECSBattleArena

This project is a console based application which simulates a battle between monsters and university students who possess various abilities and differing stats. The goal of the team of differing students is to use their various abilities in order to beat the tower of monsters.

Technologies used: Java

Notes on usage:
In order to run the program, add the easy.txt file as a CLI argument since that is required as it contains the various monsters the students are supposed to face.
